| Network Tools | âœ… Complete | Ping, traceroute, and WHOIS (now includes async traceroute job system with progressive frontend updates showing live hop discovery) |
| API Server | âœ… Complete | All endpoints with validation and error handling |
| API Documentation | âœ… Complete | Comprehensive OpenAPI specification with detailed schemas |
| Web UI | âœ… Complete | React/TypeScript frontend with all features |
| Documentation | ðŸš§ In Progress | CLI help, API docs, architecture docs |
| Testing | ðŸš§ In Progress | Unit, integration, and E2E tests |
| Containerization | âœ… Complete | Docker setup and compose configuration |
| CI/CD | âœ… Complete | GitHub Actions workflow for build and Docker |

## What Works

### Core Functionality
- CLI framework with command hierarchy
- DNS lookup for various record types
- Input validation for domains and other parameters
- Output formatting in text and JSON formats
- Error handling and timeout management
- Dependency injection container
- SMTP connection and relay testing
- Email authentication verification (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
- Network diagnostic tools (Ping, Traceroute, WHOIS)
- Advanced rate limiting with IP-based controls

### Infrastructure
- Project structure following hexagonal architecture best practices
- Repository pattern for external service access
- Docker containerization with multi-stage builds
- API server with comprehensive middleware:
  - Logging
  - Rate limiting
  - Request validation
  - Error handling
- Complete API endpoints for all diagnostic tools
- OpenAPI/Swagger documentation with comprehensive schema definitions
- Web UI with pages for all diagnostic tools and API integration
- GitHub Actions workflow for automated builds and Docker image creation

## Recent Major Accomplishments

### Milestone 17 Completion
1. âœ… Implemented progressive traceroute updates in the frontend
2. âœ… Added robust field mapping to handle backend data format variations
3. âœ… Implemented RTT formatting to display consistent millisecond values
4. âœ… Enhanced error handling to preserve partial results on timeout
5. âœ… Improved UI with better table formatting and asterisks for missing data
6. âœ… Updated OpenAPI specification to accurately document RTT format
7. âœ… Fixed issues with hop number and address display in the traceroute table
8. âœ… Added user-friendly features like persistent results after timeout

### Milestone 16 Completion
1. âœ… Completed comprehensive OpenAPI specification with detailed schema definitions
2. âœ… Implemented strong type validation for all API requests and responses
3. âœ… Enhanced API documentation with clear examples for all endpoints
4. âœ… Standardized error responses across the API surface
5. âœ… Added detailed string pattern schemas for improved validation
6. âœ… Created consistent response formats for all diagnostic tools
7. âœ… Ensured all API endpoints conform to the specification
8. âœ… Completed async traceroute job system:
   - Backend jobs now run with a background context and timeout, preventing premature cancellation
   - Frontend polls job status, shows progress, and handles timeouts/errors
   - Fixed context bug that caused jobs to be canceled early

## What's Next for Future Versions

### Immediate Priorities
1. Complete the Web UI implementation with all diagnostic tools
2. Enhance API documentation with interactive examples
3. Increase test coverage to >80% across all components
4. Add comprehensive user documentation

### Future Enhancements
1. Add user accounts for saving results and preferences
2. Implement batch processing for multiple diagnostic targets
3. Enhance result visualization with interactive charts
4. Add historical result tracking and comparison
5. Implement notification system for monitoring
6. Create API client libraries for popular languages
7. Add support for custom blacklists and validation rules
8. Enhance performance with more advanced caching strategies

## Known Issues

1. DNS lookups may timeout with certain providers in restricted environments
2. SMTP testing may be blocked by some ISPs on residential connections
3. Network tools requiring elevated privileges need better fallback mechanisms
4. Some Web UI components need optimization for mobile devices

## Lessons Learned

1. **API Specification**: Defining a comprehensive OpenAPI specification early provides a valuable contract between frontend and backend
2. **Schema Validation**: Strong typing and validation at API boundaries prevents many runtime errors
3. **Hexagonal Architecture**: Using ports and adapters significantly improved testability and modularity
4. **Middleware Design**: Creating composable middleware provided great flexibility
5. **Validation**: Implementing comprehensive validation early in the pipeline prevented many issues
6. **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling improved user experience and debugging
7. **API Documentation**: Self-documenting API endpoints made integration easier
8. **Rate Limiting**: Multi-level rate limiting protected both the API and external services
