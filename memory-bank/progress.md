# Progress

## What Works
- CLI and API for all core diagnostics (DNS, Blacklist, SMTP, Auth, Network tools)
- Engine/orchestrator, caching, rate limiting, error handling
- API endpoints, request/response models, and documentation
- Unit and integration tests for backend
- Web UI: design, implementation, API integration, components, error handling, authentication (optional), basic UI tests, documentation, styling, responsiveness, accessibility
- Network page UI allows selection of Ping, Traceroute, WHOIS
- Basic End-to-End (E2E) tests for core UI workflows using Cypress
- Dockerfile and .dockerignore for containerized builds
- Kubernetes manifests (deployment.yaml, service.yaml) for cluster deployment
- GitHub Actions CI workflow for automated build and Docker image creation

## What's Left to Build
- Final review, polish, and deployment preparation
- (Optional) Enhanced E2E test coverage (e.g., specific result assertions, error handling)
- (Optional) Image publishing automation and production Kubernetes validation

## Current Status
- Project is feature-complete and ready for final review before v1.0 deployment.
- All core features (CLI, API, UI) are implemented, styled, and have basic test coverage (unit, integration, E2E).
- Deployment infrastructure (Docker, Kubernetes, CI) is in place and ready for use.

## Known Issues
- None blocking v1.0 release. E2E test coverage could be expanded post-v1.0.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Chose Go for backend for performance and concurrency
- Adopted modular, testable architecture
- Prioritized security and input validation
- API-first approach enables flexible UI development
- Added dedicated styling and E2E testing milestones for quality assurance
- Adopted containerization and Kubernetes for deployment
- Implemented CI/CD with GitHub Actions for automated builds and deployments
