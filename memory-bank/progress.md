## What Works

### Core Functionality
- CLI framework with command hierarchy
- DNS lookup for various record types
- Input validation for domains and other parameters
- Output formatting in text and JSON formats
- Error handling and timeout management
- Dependency injection container

### Infrastructure
- Project structure following Go best practices
- Repository pattern for external service access
- Basic Docker containerization

## What's Left to Build

### Short-term Tasks
1. Complete SMTP connection testing
2. Finish blacklist checking against multiple providers
3. Implement email authentication verification
4. Add remaining network diagnostic tools
5. Extend test coverage

### Medium-term Tasks
1. Implement REST API server
2. Create OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
3. Add rate limiting for API
4. Implement caching for repeated lookups
5. Enhance error reporting

### Long-term Tasks
1. Develop Web UI with React/TypeScript
2. Add visualization for diagnostic results
3. Implement user authentication for API/UI
4. Create comprehensive documentation site
5. Add result history and comparison features

## Known Issues

1. DNS lookups may timeout with certain providers
2. SMTP testing needs better error handling for various server configurations
3. Input validation needs enhancement for edge cases
4. Performance optimization needed for concurrent operations

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Architecture Evolution
- Started with simple CLI commands, then moved to more formal hexagonal architecture
- Initially used direct external calls, later refactored to repository pattern
- Added dependency injection to improve testability and component isolation

### API Design Evolution
- Initially focused on CLI interface
- Planning RESTful API with versioning to ensure stability
- Considering GraphQL for more flexible query capabilities in the future

### UI Evolution
- Command-line interface first for core functionality
- Web UI design will focus on simplicity and clear visualization
- Mobile-responsive design planned from the beginning

## Lessons Learned

1. **Dependency Management**: Clear interfaces between components simplify testing and development
2. **Error Handling**: Consistent error wrapping and detailed error messages improve debugging
3. **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation early in the pipeline prevents cascading issues
4. **Testability**: Designing for testability from the start speeds development
5. **Documentation**: Keeping documentation current with code changes saves time

## Next Milestone Goals

1. Complete all core CLI commands with tests
2. Implement basic API server with key endpoints
3. Create initial Web UI prototype
4. Document API with OpenAPI/Swagger
5. Improve test coverage to >80%
