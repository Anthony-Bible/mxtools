# Progress

## What Works
- CLI and API for all core diagnostics (DNS, Blacklist, SMTP, Auth, Network tools)
- Engine/orchestrator, caching, rate limiting, error handling
- API endpoints, request/response models, and documentation
- Unit and integration tests for backend

## What's Left to Build
- Web UI: design, implementation, API integration, components, error handling, authentication (optional), end-to-end tests, documentation

## Current Status
- Project is at Phase 5: Web UI Implementation
- All backend and API features complete and tested
- Ready to begin frontend work

## Known Issues
- None blocking backend/API
- UI/UX design and frontend integration pending

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Chose Go for backend for performance and concurrency
- Adopted modular, testable architecture
- Prioritized security and input validation
- API-first approach enables flexible UI development
