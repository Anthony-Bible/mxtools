| Email Authentication | âœ… Complete | SPF/DKIM/DMARC verification |
| SMTP Testing | âœ… Complete | Connection, STARTTLS, and relay testing |
| Network Tools | âœ… Complete | Ping, traceroute, and WHOIS |
| API Server | âœ… Complete | All endpoints with validation and error handling |
| API Documentation | âœ… Complete | OpenAPI/Swagger and endpoint documentation |
| Web UI | ðŸš§ In Progress | React/TypeScript frontend with all features |
| Documentation | ðŸš§ In Progress | CLI help, API docs, architecture docs |
| Testing | ðŸš§ In Progress | Unit, integration, and E2E tests |
| Containerization | âœ… Complete | Docker setup and compose configuration |
| CI/CD | âœ… Complete | GitHub Actions workflow for build and Docker |

## What Works

### Core Functionality
- CLI framework with command hierarchy
- DNS lookup for various record types
- Input validation for domains and other parameters
- Output formatting in text and JSON formats
- Error handling and timeout management
- Dependency injection container
- SMTP connection and relay testing
- Email authentication verification (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
- Network diagnostic tools (Ping, Traceroute, WHOIS)
- Advanced rate limiting with IP-based controls

### Infrastructure
- Project structure following hexagonal architecture best practices
- Repository pattern for external service access
- Docker containerization with multi-stage builds
- API server with comprehensive middleware:
  - Logging
  - Rate limiting
  - Request validation
  - Error handling
- Complete API endpoints for all diagnostic tools
- OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- Web UI with pages for all diagnostic tools and API integration
- GitHub Actions workflow for automated builds and Docker image creation

## Recent Major Accomplishments

### Milestone 15 Completion
1. âœ… Added request validation for all new endpoints using validation middleware
2. âœ… Implemented comprehensive error handling for all endpoints
3. âœ… Created OpenAPI/Swagger documentation for all endpoints
4. âœ… Enhanced rate limiting with IP-based controls and burst allowances
5. âœ… Implemented endpoint documentation for API users via a dedicated docs endpoint
6. âœ… Registered all new handlers in API server setup
7. âœ… Updated API versioning to include all endpoints

## What's Next for Future Versions

### Potential Enhancements
1. Add user accounts for saving results and preferences
2. Implement batch processing for multiple diagnostic targets
3. Enhance result visualization with interactive charts
4. Add historical result tracking and comparison
5. Implement notification system for monitoring
6. Create API client libraries for popular languages
7. Add support for custom blacklists and validation rules
8. Enhance performance with more advanced caching strategies

## Known Issues

1. DNS lookups may timeout with certain providers in restricted environments
2. SMTP testing may be blocked by some ISPs on residential connections
3. Network tools requiring elevated privileges need better fallback mechanisms

## Lessons Learned

1. **Hexagonal Architecture**: Using ports and adapters significantly improved testability and modularity
2. **Middleware Design**: Creating composable middleware provided great flexibility
3. **Validation**: Implementing comprehensive validation early in the pipeline prevented many issues
4. **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling improved user experience and debugging
5. **API Documentation**: Self-documenting API endpoints made integration easier
6. **Rate Limiting**: Multi-level rate limiting protected both the API and external services
7. **Testing**: Extensive test coverage gave confidence during refactoring and feature additions
