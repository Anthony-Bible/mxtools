# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- Fully implemented hexagonal architecture (ports and adapters pattern) for clean code organization
- Fixed build issues related to interface implementation in NetworkToolsAdapter
- Fixed main.go to properly call commands.Execute() function
- Added Dockerfile and .dockerignore for containerized builds and deployment
- Added Kubernetes manifests (deployment.yaml, service.yaml) for cluster deployment
- Added GitHub Actions CI workflow to build Go backend, React UI, and Docker image for Kubernetes
- Web UI features a modern blue color scheme, improved contrast, and accessible, responsive layout
- All diagnostics pages and components have polished appearance and visual feedback
- All Web UI styling milestone tasks are complete
- Network diagnostics page updated to support Ping, Traceroute, and WHOIS via a dropdown selector
- Basic End-to-End (E2E) tests implemented using Cypress for all core diagnostic workflows (DNS, Blacklist, SMTP, Auth, Network)
- Milestone 13 (End-to-End Testing) is complete
- Project is now ready for final review, polish, and deployment preparation

## Recent Changes
- Implemented WrapResult method in NetworkToolsAdapter to properly implement NetworkToolsPort interface
- Fixed main.go to properly call commands.Execute() without trying to use its return value
- Refined project structure to follow hexagonal architecture principles
- Added Dockerfile and .dockerignore for containerization
- Added k8s/deployment.yaml and k8s/service.yaml for Kubernetes deployment
- Added .github/workflows/docker-k8s.yml for CI/CD integration
- Updated App.css with a professional blue palette, better focus states, and larger touch targets
- Improved accessibility and responsiveness for all components and layouts
- Marked all styling tasks as complete in tasks.md
- Updated Network.tsx to include a tool selector and handle different network tools
- Added Milestone 13 (End-to-End Testing) to tasks.md
- Updated techContext.md with finalized UI stack and dependencies
- Created Cypress test files: `dns.cy.js`, `blacklist.cy.js`, `smtp.cy.js`, `auth.cy.js`, `network.cy.js`
- Implemented basic tests covering page visits, form submissions, and result display checks
- Marked tasks 77-80 in `tasks.md` as complete

## Next Steps
- Consider adding an application services layer to orchestrate complex use cases
- Implement domain events for more complex inter-domain communication
- Enhance testing structure for hexagonal architecture (domain, ports, adapters)
- Add architecture documentation explaining hexagonal design and data flows
- Final review and polish of the entire application (code, UI, documentation)
- Prepare for v1.0 deployment, including Docker image publishing and Kubernetes deployment validation

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Hexagonal architecture chosen for maintainability, testability, and flexibility
- Clean separation between domain, ports, and adapters
- Dependency flow is always inward toward domain
- Containerization and Kubernetes chosen for portability and scalability
- GitHub Actions used for automated CI/CD pipeline
- Blue color scheme chosen for clarity, trust, and modern look
- Accessibility and responsive design prioritized for all users and devices
- Network page UI pattern provides a unified interface for related tools
- Basic E2E tests provide a safety net for core user workflows
- Further E2E test enhancements (e.g., asserting specific results, error handling) can be added post-v1.0

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Hexagonal (Ports and Adapters) architecture
- Domain-driven design principles
- Dependency injection for loose coupling
- Consistent, accessible color palette
- Responsive layouts and large touch targets
- Visual feedback for all interactive elements
- Consistent UI/UX patterns across all diagnostics pages
- Modular components for reusability
- Comprehensive testing (unit, integration, E2E)
- Containerized builds and deployments
- Infrastructure-as-code for deployment (Kubernetes manifests)
- Automated CI/CD workflows

## Learnings and Project Insights
- Hexagonal architecture improves maintainability and testability but requires careful planning
- Interface implementation issues can be subtle and require explicit method implementations
- Containerization and Kubernetes simplify deployment and scaling
- Automated CI/CD ensures reliable, repeatable builds and deployments
- Thoughtful color and layout choices greatly improve perceived quality and usability
- Accessibility and responsiveness are essential for professional web tools
- Grouping related tools (like network diagnostics) under a single page with a selector improves user flow
- Adding new milestones requires updating project documentation (tasks.md, memory bank)
- E2E tests are crucial for verifying user flows from the frontend to the backend
- Cypress provides a straightforward way to implement E2E tests for web applications
