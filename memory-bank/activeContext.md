# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- Added Dockerfile and .dockerignore for containerized builds and deployment.
- Added Kubernetes manifests (deployment.yaml, service.yaml) for cluster deployment.
- Added GitHub Actions CI workflow to build Go backend, React UI, and Docker image for Kubernetes.
- Web UI features a modern blue color scheme, improved contrast, and accessible, responsive layout.
- All diagnostics pages and components have polished appearance and visual feedback.
- All Web UI styling milestone tasks are complete.
- Network diagnostics page updated to support Ping, Traceroute, and WHOIS via a dropdown selector.
- Basic End-to-End (E2E) tests implemented using Cypress for all core diagnostic workflows (DNS, Blacklist, SMTP, Auth, Network).
- Milestone 13 (End-to-End Testing) is complete.
- Project is now ready for final review, polish, and deployment preparation.

## Recent Changes
- Added Dockerfile and .dockerignore for containerization.
- Added k8s/deployment.yaml and k8s/service.yaml for Kubernetes deployment.
- Added .github/workflows/docker-k8s.yml for CI/CD integration.
- Updated App.css with a professional blue palette, better focus states, and larger touch targets.
- Improved accessibility and responsiveness for all components and layouts.
- Marked all styling tasks as complete in tasks.md.
- Updated Network.tsx to include a tool selector and handle different network tools.
- Added Milestone 13 (End-to-End Testing) to tasks.md.
- Updated techContext.md with finalized UI stack and dependencies.
- Created Cypress test files: `dns.cy.js`, `blacklist.cy.js`, `smtp.cy.js`, `auth.cy.js`, `network.cy.js`.
- Implemented basic tests covering page visits, form submissions, and result display checks.
- Marked tasks 77-80 in `tasks.md` as complete.

## Next Steps
- Final review and polish of the entire application (code, UI, documentation).
- Prepare for v1.0 deployment, including Docker image publishing and Kubernetes deployment validation.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Containerization and Kubernetes chosen for portability and scalability.
- GitHub Actions used for automated CI/CD pipeline.
- Blue color scheme chosen for clarity, trust, and modern look.
- Accessibility and responsive design prioritized for all users and devices.
- Network page UI pattern provides a unified interface for related tools.
- Basic E2E tests provide a safety net for core user workflows.
- Further E2E test enhancements (e.g., asserting specific results, error handling) can be added post-v1.0.

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Consistent, accessible color palette
- Responsive layouts and large touch targets
- Visual feedback for all interactive elements
- Consistent UI/UX patterns across all diagnostics pages.
- Modular components for reusability.
- Comprehensive testing (unit, integration, E2E).
- Containerized builds and deployments.
- Infrastructure-as-code for deployment (Kubernetes manifests).
- Automated CI/CD workflows.

## Learnings and Project Insights
- Containerization and Kubernetes simplify deployment and scaling.
- Automated CI/CD ensures reliable, repeatable builds and deployments.
- Thoughtful color and layout choices greatly improve perceived quality and usability.
- Accessibility and responsiveness are essential for professional web tools.
- Grouping related tools (like network diagnostics) under a single page with a selector improves user flow.
- Adding new milestones requires updating project documentation (tasks.md, memory bank).
- E2E tests are crucial for verifying user flows from the frontend to the backend.
- Cypress provides a straightforward way to implement E2E tests for web applications.
