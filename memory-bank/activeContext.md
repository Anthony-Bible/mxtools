# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The project has completed the Web UI development including the progressive traceroute feature. Current focus is on:

1. Finalizing documentation for all components
2. Enhancing test coverage across the codebase
3. Preparing for potential deployment and user testing

## Recent Changes

Recent development has concentrated on:

1. Completed implementation of progressive traceroute updates in the frontend:
   - Added live updates showing each hop as it's discovered during traceroute
   - Implemented robust field mapping to handle backend data format variations (capitalized fields)
   - Added RTT formatting to display consistent millisecond values with proper precision
   - Enhanced error handling to preserve partial results when traceroute times out
   - Improved UI with better table formatting and asterisks for missing data
   - Updated OpenAPI specification to accurately document RTT format

2. Completed all API endpoints matching the OpenAPI specification
3. Finalized OpenAPI documentation with detailed schema definitions for all data types
4. Enhanced input validation and error handling across all endpoints
5. Set up comprehensive testing for the API server and endpoints

## Next Steps

Immediate next steps include:

1. Complete documentation
   - Finalize user documentation for all features
   - Add developer documentation for API integration
   - Create deployment guides for various environments

2. Enhance test coverage
   - Add more end-to-end tests for complete user flows
   - Enhance integration tests for all adapters
   - Add performance benchmarks for critical paths

3. Prepare for deployment
   - Finalize Docker configuration
   - Create deployment scripts for common environments
   - Prepare monitoring and logging setup

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions
1. Maintaining strict adherence to hexagonal architecture principles
2. Using OpenAPI specification as the single source of truth for API contracts
3. Adopting consistent error handling and validation patterns across all endpoints

### Implementation Approach
1. API-first development ensures compatibility with multiple client types
2. Comprehensive schema validation for all API requests and responses
3. Consistent patterns for error reporting and handling
4. Focus on developer experience with clear documentation
5. Progressive UI updates for long-running operations like traceroute

### Performance Considerations
1. Implementing appropriate caching for repeated queries
2. Optimizing concurrent DNS and network tool operations
3. Ensuring efficient UI rendering for complex diagnostic results
4. Managing rate limits to balance user experience with system protection
5. Providing immediate feedback for long-running operations

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Organization
- Maintain clear separation between API layers and domain logic
- Keep schema definitions consistent between OpenAPI spec and code
- Use consistent error types and status codes across all endpoints

### Error Handling
- Standardized error responses with proper HTTP status codes
- Detailed error messages with actionable information
- Graceful degradation for partial service failures
- Preserve partial results when operations timeout or fail
- Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting

### UI Design Patterns
- Progressive updates for long-running operations
- Consistent formatting of technical data (IP addresses, time values)
- Clear error states with recovery options
- Responsive design for all device sizes
- Graceful handling of missing or incomplete data

## Learnings and Project Insights
