# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The project is currently focused on completing the Web UI development and refining the API documentation. This includes:

1. Finalizing the React/TypeScript UI components for visualization of diagnostic results
2. Ensuring the OpenAPI specification is complete and accurate
3. Polishing documentation for all API endpoints
4. Enhancing test coverage across the codebase

## Recent Changes

Recent development has concentrated on:

1. Completed implementation of all API endpoints matching the OpenAPI specification
2. Finalized OpenAPI documentation with detailed schema definitions for all data types
3. Enhanced input validation and error handling across all endpoints
4. Set up comprehensive testing for the API server and endpoints

## Next Steps

Immediate next steps include:

1. Complete Web UI development
   - Finalize React components for all diagnostic tools
   - Implement responsive design for all device sizes
   - Add visualization components for complex data (DNS records, traceroute)
   - Integrate with API using consistent error handling

2. Enhance API documentation
   - Ensure all endpoints have comprehensive examples
   - Validate OpenAPI specification against implementation
   - Create interactive API documentation with Swagger UI

3. Increase test coverage
   - Add more end-to-end tests for complete user flows
   - Enhance integration tests for all adapters
   - Add performance benchmarks for critical paths

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions
1. Maintaining strict adherence to hexagonal architecture principles
2. Using OpenAPI specification as the single source of truth for API contracts
3. Adopting consistent error handling and validation patterns across all endpoints

### Implementation Approach
1. API-first development ensures compatibility with multiple client types
2. Comprehensive schema validation for all API requests and responses
3. Consistent patterns for error reporting and handling
4. Focus on developer experience with clear documentation

### Performance Considerations
1. Implementing appropriate caching for repeated queries
2. Optimizing concurrent DNS and network tool operations
3. Ensuring efficient UI rendering for complex diagnostic results
4. Managing rate limits to balance user experience with system protection

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Organization
- Maintain clear separation between API layers and domain logic
- Keep schema definitions consistent between OpenAPI spec and code
- Use consistent error types and status codes across all endpoints

### Error Handling
- Standardized error responses with proper HTTP status codes
- Detailed error messages with actionable information
- Graceful degradation for partial service failures
- Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting

### Testing Approach
- API contract tests based on OpenAPI specification
- Component tests for complex integrations
- Performance tests for critical paths
- UI tests for user flows

## Learnings and Project Insights
