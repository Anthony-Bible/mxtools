# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
MXToolbox is a critical tool for diagnosing domain, DNS, and email issues, but is proprietary. This project provides an open-source alternative, empowering users with transparency, extensibility, and self-hosting.

## Problems Solved
- Lack of open, self-hosted alternatives to MXToolbox
- Need for integrated diagnostics in one tool
- Desire for automation and API access
- Need for modern, scriptable, and UI-driven workflows

## How It Should Work
- Users can run diagnostics via CLI, API, or Web UI
- Results are clear, actionable, and exportable
- System is responsive, secure, and easy to operate

## User Experience Goals
- Fast, intuitive diagnostics
- Clear error messages and guidance
- Consistent experience across CLI, API, and UI
- Accessible to both technical and less-technical users
